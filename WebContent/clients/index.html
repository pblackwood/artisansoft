						The companies below have benefited from my consulting expertise over the last several years. 
						I am grateful for the friendships made and the very satisfying technical 
						challenges which these projects provided.
					</p>
					<p >
						In some cases I have done more than one project for a client. I am very proud of these "repeat customers"
						and I hope to return for more successes in the future.

					<h3>

					</h3>
					<p >
						While full-time at Fiserv, I worked on a Java servlet-based application 
						to integrate banking clients to the core Fiserv banking applications 
						hosted on IBM mainframe.  The integration was exceptionally challenging
						because Fiserv had developed their own proprietary transaction monitor,
						which, while lightning fast, did not support CICS or other industry 
						standard middleware, so we had to build it.
					</p>
					<p>
						My first task at Fiserv was to build an administration tool in Swing
						which was deployed on desktops at key client sites.  I have dabbled
						in Java desktop technologies on other projects also.
