					<p>
						Java Enterprise consultant ready to take on your most difficult integration challenges. 
						Put my 23 years of hands-on experience to work on your next mission-critical software 
						project.  
					</p>
					<p>
						Proven technical leadership that will directly benefit your company’s bottom line. 
						The applications I build get deployed and get used. They delight end-users and 
						developers alike – the former because they are easy to use and the latter because 
						they are easy to extend.
					</p>
					<p>
						This quote aptly summarizes my views on software engineering:
					</p>
					<div class="quote">
						<p>
							Sometimes the biggest gains in productivity come from stopping to think about 
							<em>what</em> you're doing, <em>why</em> you're doing it, and <em>whether</em> 
							it's a good idea. The best developers don't just find something that works and 
							use it; they also question why it works, try to understand it, and then improve it.
