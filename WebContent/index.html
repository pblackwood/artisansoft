            <h1>Solution Design & Architecture</h1>
            <p>
                My whole career has been about making sound engineering decisions. It's not about the newest or coolest
                technologies. It's about finding the solution you and your team can <em>actually deliver</em> in the
                time
                and budget you have.

                It's always a balancing act between feature set and simplicity, build vs buy, performance vs rich user
                experience. I am good at managing the interplay of different priorities.
            </p>
            <h1>Team Leadership</h1>
            <p>
                I can lead teams from start to finish on complex projects. I have always gotten rave reviews on my
                project
                deliverables, tests, cloud deployments and team dynamics (aka we have fun while getting things
                done).
            </p>
            <p>
                I love mentoring and coaching newer developers and can also talk solution architecture with your most
                senior
                technologists.

                In my last FT role I was both a hands-on Lead Consultant and also a People Manager for 4-5 direct
                reports.
                So I'm familiar with HR management as well as project management and I enjoy both roles.
            </p>
            <h1>Communication</h1>
            <p>
                Communication is my superpower. I am equally comfortable talking about requirements with business
                leaders,
                UX/UI with with product designers, technical trade-offs with engineers, and KPIs with management.
            </p>
            <h1>Consulting</h1>
            <p>
                Let me help you with your software development <em>process</em> as well as the <em>tasks</em>. I know
                what
                works and what doesn't. Contact me for details of how this might work in practice.
            </p>
            <h1>How to Work with Me</h1>
            <p>
                I can consult directly with you on an hourly basis though my company, Artisan Solutions LLC. See Rates
                in the header above. Or if you would prefer, you can hire me to work on a specific idea on a project
                basis. Initial conversations are always free.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternatively, you can partner with a software services firm and hire me a sub-contractor as I have done
                many
                times in the past. Check out my list of superb partners I have worked with below.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can also take on bigger projects and staff them with my own team. Let's talk!
