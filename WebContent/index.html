						This is the business website of Peter Swartwout,<br> a unique consultant 
						with 23 years' experience who strives to always bring artistry
						to technology.
					</p>
					<p>
						I specialize in high-performance multi-user web applications
						built on the Java platform.  I have spearheaded many high-visibility,
						mission-critical projects featured on the <a href="clients/index.html">Clients</a> page.
					</p>
					<p>
						My solid background in the Java/J2EE platform, Agile project management, Ruby on Rails development,
						REST and SOAP service integration, GUI programming, and database development will help 
						you solve the most demanding IT challenges.

					<h3>
						<span>What I Offer</span>
					</h3>
					<p>
						I can add value to your project in many ways, as a design consultant,
						team leader, or individual coder, depending on your specific needs and
						the experience level of your team.
					</p> 
					<p>
						I have a strong preference for lightweight architecture using
        				open-source technologies and agile software development methodology.
						Open-source development keeps costs low while providing an ever-expanding
						feature set. I enjoy keeping up with the rapidly changing technology 
						landscape so you don't have to.
					</p>
					<p>
						Agile methodology means something different to every company, but the
						general idea is finding the sweet spot of <span class="em">process formality</span>
						so your team spends its time solving problems and not "doing the process".
						Knowing how to find that delicate balance point is crucial to project 
						success and is something of an art form, gained with experience.
