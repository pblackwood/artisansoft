					<p class="p1">
						Peter is a technology professional living in Pittsburgh, 
						Pennsylvania with his wife <a target="_blank" href="http://www.darasgardendreams.com">Dara<a>.
											</p>
					<p>In addition to keeping up on new technologies like the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.meanjs.org">MEAN Stack</a>, I love backgammon, music, craft beer, and gardening.</p>
					<p>
						I have been practicing the art of making technology
						work for <span class="em">people</span> for over 20 years. 
						Since becoming a consultant in 2005, I have had the privilege to work 
						with many different organizations in many different domains. One of my 
						greatest assets is the ability to learn new domains and new technology 
						stacks very quickly. The bonus for me is I get to work with interesting people who are eager to 
						learn and improve, as I am.

						<h3>Web Development</h3>
						This category includes a whole range of skills to put content into a browser: Javascript, html, css,

						I am in the process of completely rewriting this website on the MEAN stack.
